#Timothy Dixon
I am driven by the desire to learn everything there is to know about Information Systems. My interests within information systems are: SAP ERP/ABAP, Data Mining/Machine Learning, Database Development, and Mobile Technologies. I am currently a senior at East Tennessee State University completing my Bachelor's in Computing, with a concentration in Information Systems and an emphasis in Accounting. Please take a look around, and if you have any questions/comments don't hesitate to contact me!
